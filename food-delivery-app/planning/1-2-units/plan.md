# Plan: Group User Stories into Independent Units

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to analyze and group the 40 user stories from the food delivery platform into independent, loosely coupled units that can be built by separate teams.

## Analysis and Grouping Steps

### Phase 1: Analysis and Unit Definition
- [x] **Step 1**: Analyze user stories and identify natural domain boundaries
  - Review all 40 user stories across 4 personas (Customer, Restaurant Owner, Delivery Rider, Admin)
  - Identify core business capabilities and data ownership patterns
  - Map dependencies between user stories

- [x] **Step 2**: Define independent units based on domain-driven design principles
  - Group highly cohesive user stories that share similar data and business logic
  - Ensure units can operate independently with minimal cross-unit dependencies
  - **Note**: Need your confirmation on the proposed unit boundaries before proceeding

### Phase 2: Unit Documentation
- [x] **Step 3**: Create unit-specific user story files
  - Create individual .md files in `/inception/units/` for each identified unit
  - Include user stories and acceptance criteria for each unit
  - Ensure each unit contains complete, actionable requirements

- [x] **Step 4**: Define integration contracts
  - Identify necessary API endpoints for each unit
  - Define data exchange formats and communication patterns
  - Document service interfaces in `/inception/units/integration_contract.md`
  - **Note**: Need your review of API contracts before finalizing

### Phase 3: Validation and Review
- [x] **Step 5**: Validate unit independence
  - Verify each unit can be built and deployed independently
  - Confirm loose coupling between units
  - Check that all original user stories are covered

- [x] **Step 6**: Final review and documentation cleanup
  - Ensure all files are properly formatted and complete
  - Verify integration contracts are comprehensive
  - **Note**: Final review required before completion

## Proposed Unit Structure (Preliminary)

Based on initial analysis, I'm considering these potential units:

1. **Customer Experience Unit** - Customer-facing features (browsing, ordering, tracking)
2. **Restaurant Management Unit** - Restaurant operations and menu management
3. **Delivery Operations Unit** - Rider management and delivery logistics
4. **Payment Processing Unit** - Payment handling and financial transactions
5. **Platform Administration Unit** - Admin functions and system management
6. **Notification & Communication Unit** - Cross-cutting communication services

**⚠️ CONFIRMATION NEEDED**: Please review this preliminary structure before I proceed with detailed grouping.

## Dependencies and Considerations

- Units must be loosely coupled but will need well-defined integration points
- Some user stories may span multiple units and require careful API design
- Real-time features (tracking, notifications) may require event-driven architecture
- Payment processing has strict security and compliance requirements

## Next Steps

After your approval of this plan, I will:
1. Execute each step systematically
2. Update checkboxes as completed
3. Seek your confirmation at noted decision points
4. Deliver complete unit documentation with integration contracts

**Please review and approve this plan before I begin execution.**
