# Requirements

We want to build a system like Grab Food. Users can place order for food items from a restaurant. The restaurant has to accept that order. A delivery rider will be assigned to the delivery and make that delivery to the user. There should be payment for the food, and delivery rider gets a cut from the payment. Please decide what other requirements an app like Grab Food should have.
